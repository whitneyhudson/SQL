#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many many unique orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
,Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.OrderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
